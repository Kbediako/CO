### How to Use
- Draft the canonical PRD in `/tasks` using `/.ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md` alongside `.agent/task/templates/prd-template.md`.
- After approvals, reflect key highlights here and link back to the canonical file.
- Keep this snapshot concise; defer detailed decisions to the `/tasks` source of truth.
