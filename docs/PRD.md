# Product Requirements Template — Codex-Orchestrator

Use this document to capture the user-facing goals for your project. Fill it in after you define the problem space.

## Vision
- _What problem are we solving? Who benefits?_

## Success Metrics
- _List qualitative and quantitative targets (e.g., time-to-review, automation coverage)._ 

## User Stories
- _Story 1_: _As a <persona>, I want …_
- _Story 2_: _Add more as needed._

## Non-Goals
- _Explicitly state anything out of scope._

## Launch Criteria
- _Define the evidence required before shipping or handing off._

Keep this PRD synchronized with `/tasks` and the action plan so reviewers can validate progress from the run artifacts.
