## Added by Orchestrator 2025-10-16

- **Context:** Task list translates PRD 0001 into 6 parent tasks covering governance, specs, core implementation, learning library, adapters/evaluation, and guardrails.
- **Gate Status:** All parent tasks currently `planned`; mini-spec subtasks required before touching orchestrator core, learning assets, or adapters.
- **Notes:** Pending PRD approval; technical spec and mini-specs must be produced before moving to implementation phases.

## Checklist Convention
- Mirror the canonical checklist markers—start each task/subtask as `[ ]` and flip to `[x]` the moment work completes, citing the supporting manifest/log.
- Example (mirrors §3.1): `- [x] Completed 2025-10-16 — see .runs/3/2025-10-16T02-28-10Z/manifest.json for approval record.`
