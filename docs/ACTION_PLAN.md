# Action Plan Template — Codex-Orchestrator

Use this document to capture milestones, owners, and validation evidence for your project. Populate each section after cloning the repository and defining the task scope.

## Status Snapshot
- **Canonical sources:** _(add PRD / spec links here)_
- **Run evidence:** _(list manifests or logs once you have them)_
- **Open follow-up:** _(track outstanding actions)_

## Milestone Outline
Describe each milestone with objective, tasks, acceptance criteria, and risks.

### Milestone M1 — _(name)_
- Objective: _What success looks like._
- Tasks:
  1. _Role_ — _Description_; Acceptance: _Definition of done_; Risks: _Potential blockers_.

### Milestone M2 — _(name)_
- Objective: _Add details._
- Tasks:
  1. _Repeat structure above._

Add more milestones or sections as your project requires. Remember to mirror updates back into `/tasks` and `.agent/` so automation stays aligned.
