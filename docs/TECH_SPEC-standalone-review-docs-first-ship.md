# Technical Spec — Standalone Review + Docs-First Shipping (Task 0953)

## Overview
- Objective: Ship standalone review guidance and docs-first workflow updates with consistent terminology and required artifacts.
- Scope: Documentation, templates, skills, task checklists, and registry updates.
- Canonical TECH_SPEC: `tasks/specs/0953-standalone-review-docs-first-ship.md`.

## Technical Requirements (Summary)
- Require PRD + TECH_SPEC + ACTION_PLAN + task checklist for every task; depth scales with scope.
- Delegation MCP enabled by default (only MCP on by default); enable other MCPs only when relevant.
- Record pre-implementation standalone review approval in PRD/TECH_SPEC and mirror to checklists.
- Replace mini-spec terminology with TECH_SPEC across core guidance.
