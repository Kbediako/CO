# Action Plan - Documentation Freshness Sweep (Task 0921)

## Status Snapshot
- Current Phase: Completed
- Run Manifest Link (pre-change): `.runs/0921-docs-freshness-sweep/cli/2025-12-30T23-47-14-831Z-435ea063/manifest.json`
- Run Manifest Link (post-change): `.runs/0921-docs-freshness-sweep/cli/2025-12-31T00-09-56-620Z-9f528ad7/manifest.json`
- Approvals / Escalations: record in `tasks/index.json`

## Evidence Notes
- `metrics.json` is NDJSON (one JSON object per line; parse line-by-line).
- `out/<task-id>/state.json` is generated by metrics aggregation.

## Milestones & Tasks
1. Planning + collateral
   - Draft PRD/tech spec/action plan/checklist/mini-spec.
   - Update `tasks/index.json` and `docs/TASKS.md` mirrors.
   - Capture docs-review manifest (pre-change).
2. Docs audit + updates
   - Run docs-hygiene and spec-guard.
   - Fix stale references and refresh spec dates as needed.
   - Capture docs-review manifest (post-change).
3. Validation + handoff
   - Update checklists and evidence paths.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: docs-check failures due to missing or moved paths.
  - Mitigation: run docs-hygiene and resolve errors systematically.
- Risk: spec-guard failures on stale specs.
  - Mitigation: update spec metadata with current review date.

## Next Review
- Date: Not scheduled (complete).
- Agenda: Post-sweep check-in if new doc drift is detected.
