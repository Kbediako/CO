# ACTION_PLAN - Playwright Context Control + Subagent Guardrails (0969)

## Phase 1 - Docs-first scaffold
1. Add PRD + TECH_SPEC + ACTION_PLAN + checklist mirrors.
2. Register task/spec in `tasks/index.json` and `docs/TASKS.md`.
3. Capture delegation scout and docs-review evidence.

## Phase 2 - Implementation
1. Update shipped docs/skills with explicit high-output subagent routing and summary-only handoff policy.
2. Update local/global Playwright skill wrapper + workflow guidance for current executable and low-noise patterns.
3. Update local/global frontend testing/review/game skills to prefer bounded Playwright subagent streams.

## Phase 3 - Validation and handoff
1. Run full guardrail chain (delegation/spec guard, build/lint/test/docs, diff-budget, review).
2. Run standalone post-implementation review + explicit elegance/minimality pass.
3. Capture manual wrapper/workflow validation logs.
