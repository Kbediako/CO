# Task 0908 — Diff Budget + Review Handoff Follow-ups

- MCP Task ID: `0908-diff-budget-followups`
- Primary PRD: _(TBD)_
- Mini-spec: _(TBD)_

## Checklist
### TODO
- [ ] Add an explicit CI override path for diff-budget (e.g., PR label + reason surfaced in logs) without weakening the default gate.
- [ ] Add tests for `scripts/diff-budget.mjs` (commit-scoped mode, untracked-too-large failure, ignore list, override reason).
- [ ] Update `README.md` to document diff-budget expectations and the recommended `NOTES="<goal + summary + risks>" npm run review` invocation.
