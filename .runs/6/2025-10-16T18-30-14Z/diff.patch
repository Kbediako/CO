 ## Milestone M1 — Skeleton Orchestrator & MCP Demo
 - Objective: Establish repo scaffolding with working Agents SDK manager, handoffs, and local MCP demo editing one file end-to-end.
 - Tasks:
   1. Reviewer — Secure approvals for architecture mini-spec (`tasks/specs/0001-orchestrator-architecture.md`); Acceptance: spec status set to `in-progress`→`done` in `/tasks/index.json`, approval signatures captured; Effort: 0.5 day; Risks: stakeholder misalignment → Mitigation: host quick walkthrough before sign-off.
   2. Manager — Draft orchestrator core mini-spec (`tasks/specs/0002-orchestrator-core.md`) and route for approval; Acceptance: spec stub created, approvals captured, `/tasks/index.json` updated with `last_review` ≤30 days; Effort: 1 day; Risks: unclear persistence requirements → Mitigation: validate with security and platform leads before submission.
-  3. Manager — Finalize bootstrap instructions and approval workflow notes in `AGENTS.md`; Acceptance: approvals captured, SOP hooks documented; Effort: 1 day; Risks: SOP drift → Mitigation: schedule quick security review.
+  3. Manager — Finalize bootstrap instructions and approval workflow notes in `AGENTS.md`; Acceptance: approvals captured, SOP hooks documented; Effort: 1 day; Risks: SOP drift → Mitigation: schedule quick security review. **Status:** Completed; see `AGENTS.md` (2025-10-16 update) and `.runs/6/2025-10-16T18-19-14Z/diff.patch`.
   4. Builder — Implement manager/builder/tester stubs in `orchestrator/src` and wire to `codex mcp-server`; Acceptance: `scripts/run-local-mcp.sh` executes demo edit producing diff artifact; Effort: 3 days; Risks: MCP config mismatch → Mitigation: add dry-run validation script.
   5. Tester — Author smoke tests under `orchestrator/tests` validating MCP run plus lint/test commands; Acceptance: `npm test` green with recorded logs in `.runs/`; Effort: 2 days; Risks: flaky MCP responses → Mitigation: cache fixtures, add retry logic.

   1. Reviewer — Draft and approve learning library mini-spec (`tasks/specs/0003-learning-library.md`); Acceptance: spec added to `/tasks/index.json` with `last_review` ≤30 days and approval signatures captured; Effort: 0.5 day; Risks: scope creep → Mitigation: limit first iteration to two codemods + one linter.
   2. Manager — Configure Codex Cloud workspace integration and document approval toggles; Acceptance: `scripts/run-parallel-goals.ts --dry-run` enumerates planned jobs; Effort: 2 days; Risks: approval misconfiguration → Mitigation: require dry-run sign-off before live runs.
   3. Builder — Implement codemods/linters/templates under `patterns/` with reusable APIs; Acceptance: assets versioned and sample usage recorded in `/tasks/index.json`; Effort: 4 days; Risks: regressions on target repos → Mitigation: add rollback notes and fixture coverage.

+- Guardrails CI package landed: `scripts/spec-guard.sh` enforces spec freshness and the example GitHub Actions workflow documents trigger strategy.
+- Learning library & evaluation harness delivered with supporting manifests (`.runs/4/`, `.runs/5/`).
+- Pending follow-up: finalize Task 6 documentation mirrors (this file, `docs/ACTION_PLAN.md`, `docs/TECH_SPEC.md`) for sign-off.

 - **Fixtures & Patterns:** Fixtures (e.g., TypeScript smoke, Python lint) live in `evaluation/fixtures/**` with README guidance and optional pattern assertions referencing learning library assets.
 - **Validation:** `npm run eval:test` executes Vitest suites covering planner, reporter, and scenario smoke tests so evaluation joins the standard build/lint/test gating.
 - **Guardrails:** Harness defaults to MCP-safe mode, redacts sensitive env vars before logging, and enforces spec guard freshness (`last_review ≤30 days`) prior to syncing results to Codex Cloud.

+## Update — 2025-10-16 Guardrails & Approvals
+- `scripts/spec-guard.sh` now validates mini-spec freshness (≤30 days) and provides a dry-run mode for local testing.
+- `.github/workflows/spec-guard.example.yml` documents how to enable CI enforcement, including fetching the full git history and exporting `BASE_SHA` for pull requests.
+- Approval metadata (mode, reviewer decisions) must be recorded inside `.runs/<task>/<timestamp>/manifest.json`; see `.runs/6/2025-10-16T18-19-14Z/manifest.json` for Task 6 evidence.
+- Mirrors (`AGENTS.md`, `.agent/readme.md`, `.agent/SOPs/specs-and-research.md`) describe build/test commands, execution mode policy, and MCP registration steps aligned with the canonical spec.
