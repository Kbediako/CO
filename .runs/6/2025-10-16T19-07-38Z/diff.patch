-- `npm run lint` (always) — runs `npm run build:patterns` first.
-- `npm run test` — covers orchestrator agents, persistence, and adapter logic.
-- `npm run eval:test` — validates evaluation harness; ensure fixtures in `evaluation/fixtures/**` are in sync.
-- `bash scripts/spec-guard.sh --dry-run` — verify specs updated before review.
