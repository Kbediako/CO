# Run Artifacts Directory

This directory stores per-task run manifests and transient logs generated by the Codex-Orchestrator.

- `./<taskId>/<runId>/manifest.json` — auto-written by the persistence coordinator after `run:completed` events. Consumers (reviewers, cloud-sync worker) should treat this as the source of truth for run metadata.
- `./<taskId>.lock` — advisory lock file asserted while the TaskStateStore updates `/out/<taskId>/state.json` to avoid concurrent writers.
- Additional files (e.g., lint/test logs, diffs) may be dropped by agents or humans; the manifest captures references for downstream syncing.

The cloud-sync worker watches for completed runs and mirrors manifest summaries to Codex Cloud using the `runId` as an idempotency key.
