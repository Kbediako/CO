# Crystalizer v1

- Write Markdown with three sections: Problem, Solution, Rationale.
- Base the content only on validated patches and run context; no speculation or new code.
- Keep Solution prescriptive and short (bullets or steps); keep Rationale to 2–3 sentences.
- Note any assumptions or required follow-up explicitly.
