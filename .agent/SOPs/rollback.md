# Rollback SOP

## Added by Bootstrap 2025-10-16

1. Define rollback triggers (metrics, alarms, verification failures) ahead of deployment.
2. Keep hotfix branches and migration reversal scripts ready.
3. When triggered, halt traffic changes, execute rollback artifacts, and verify recovery tests.
4. Document timelines, root causes, and residual risk in `/tasks` and the incident log.
