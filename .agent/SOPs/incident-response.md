1. Declare an incident channel and assign roles (commander, comms, scribe).
2. Stabilize impact using runbooks, feature flags, or rollbacks.
3. Capture timelines, customer impact, and mitigations in `/tasks/research` or dedicated notes.
4. Communicate status updates to stakeholders until resolved.
5. Schedule a post-incident review referencing `.agent/SOPs/postmortems.md`.
