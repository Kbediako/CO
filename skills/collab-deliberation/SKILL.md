# Collab Deliberation

Use this skill when the user asks for brainstorming, multiple approaches, pros/cons, or decision support. This skill is for **ideas**, not implementation.

## Workflow

1) Clarify the decision: summarize the goal, constraints, and success criteria.
2) Generate options: 3–5 distinct approaches with short descriptions.
3) Compare tradeoffs: cost, risk, speed, maintenance, and alignment with guardrails.
4) Recommend: choose a recommended approach and explain why.
5) Open questions: list 1–3 questions that would change the recommendation.

## Guardrails
- Separate ideas from decisions.
- Do not implement or modify code unless explicitly asked.
- Keep outputs concise and action-oriented.
